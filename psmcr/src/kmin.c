/* Hooke-Jeeves algorithm for nonlinear minimization
   Heng Li, Februay 3, 2008
 
   Based on the pseudocodes by Bell and Pike (CACM 9(9):684-685), and
   the revision by Tomlin and Smith (CACM 12(11):637-638). Both of the
   papers are comments on Kaupe's Algorithm 178 "Direct Search" (ACM
   6(6):313-314). The original algorithm was designed by Hooke and
   Jeeves (ACM 8:212-229). This program is further revised according to
   Johnson's implementation at Netlib (opt/hooke.c).
 
   Hooke-Jeeves algorithm is very simple and it works quite well on a
   few examples. However, it might fail to converge due to its heuristic
   nature. A possible improvement, as is suggested by Johnson, may be to
   choose a small r at the beginning to quickly approach to the minimum
   and a large r at later step to hit the minimum.
